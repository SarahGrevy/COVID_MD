In this experiment we are studying moral judgments and discussions about morally charged events. You will be exposed to a mixture of pictures, videos and short texts. You will make moral judgements on the situations by answering some questions and discuss them with a parter. 
<div>&nbsp;</div>
In each trial you will watch a video, answer a question, discuss the video with each other, and then rewatch the video or image and give individual judgements again. 
<div>&nbsp;</div>
The research assistant will guide you through a practise trial and afterwards you will be on your own.
